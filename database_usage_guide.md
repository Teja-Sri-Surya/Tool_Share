# Database Objects Usage Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to use the database views, stored procedures, triggers, and events created for the Tool Sharing application.

## üìä Views

### 1. Active Rentals View (`v_active_rentals`)
Shows all currently active rentals with status information.

```sql
-- View all active rentals
SELECT * FROM v_active_rentals;

-- View overdue rentals
SELECT * FROM v_active_rentals WHERE rental_status = 'Overdue';

-- View rentals due today
SELECT * FROM v_active_rentals WHERE rental_status = 'Due Today';
```

### 2. User Statistics View (`v_user_statistics`)
Provides comprehensive user statistics and metrics.

```sql
-- View all user statistics
SELECT * FROM v_user_statistics;

-- Find top users by revenue
SELECT username, total_rental_revenue 
FROM v_user_statistics 
ORDER BY total_rental_revenue DESC;

-- Find users with most tools
SELECT username, tools_owned 
FROM v_user_statistics 
ORDER BY tools_owned DESC;
```

### 3. Tool Availability View (`v_tool_availability`)
Shows tool availability and rental history.

```sql
-- View all tools and their availability
SELECT * FROM v_tool_availability;

-- Find available tools
SELECT * FROM v_tool_availability WHERE availability_status = 'Available';

-- Find most popular tools
SELECT tool_name, total_rentals 
FROM v_tool_availability 
ORDER BY total_rentals DESC;
```

### 4. Revenue Report View (`v_revenue_report`)
Monthly revenue reports by user.

```sql
-- View all revenue reports
SELECT * FROM v_revenue_report;

-- View current month revenue
SELECT * FROM v_revenue_report 
WHERE month = DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(), '%Y-%m');

-- Find top earners
SELECT owner_username, SUM(total_revenue) as total_earnings
FROM v_revenue_report 
GROUP BY owner_username 
ORDER BY total_earnings DESC;
```

## üîß Stored Procedures

### 1. Create Rental (`sp_create_rental`)
Creates a new rental transaction with validation.

```sql
-- Create a rental
CALL sp_create_rental(1, 2, 1, '2025-08-01', '2025-08-03', 150.00, @rental_id, @status);
SELECT @rental_id, @status;

-- Parameters:

-- 2: borrower_id (person renting)
-- 3: tool_id (tool being rented)
-- 4: start_date (rental start date)
-- 5: end_date (rental end date)
-- 6: total_price (total rental cost)
-- 7: @rental_id (output: created rental ID)
-- 8: @status (output: success/error message)
```

### 2. Complete Rental (`sp_complete_rental`)
Marks a rental as completed and makes tool available again.

```sql
-- Complete a rental
CALL sp_complete_rental(1, @status);
SELECT @status;

-- Parameters:
-- 1: rental_id (ID of rental to complete)
-- 2: @status (output: success/error message)
```

### 3. Calculate User Rating (`sp_calculate_user_rating`)
Recalculates user rating based on feedback.

```sql
-- Calculate rating for user ID 1
CALL sp_calculate_user_rating(1);
```

### 4. Get User Dashboard (`sp_get_user_dashboard`)
Gets dashboard data for a specific user.

```sql
-- Get dashboard data for user ID 1
CALL sp_get_user_dashboard(1);
```

## ‚ö° Triggers

### Automatic Actions
The following triggers run automatically:

1. **Tool Availability**: When a rental is created, the tool becomes unavailable
2. **User Statistics**: When a rental is created, user rental count increases
3. **Rating Updates**: When feedback is added/updated, user rating is recalculated
4. **Audit Trail**: When rentals are created, audit logs are generated

## üïí Events

### Scheduled Tasks
The following events run automatically:

1. **Daily Rental Update** (`ev_daily_rental_update`)
   - Runs every day
   - Marks overdue rentals
   - Updates user statistics

2. **Weekly Revenue Report** (`ev_weekly_revenue_report`)
   - Runs every week
   - Creates weekly revenue summaries

3. **Monthly Cleanup** (`ev_monthly_cleanup`)
   - Runs every month
   - Archives old rentals
   - Cleans up old sessions

## üìà Common Queries

### Business Intelligence Queries

```sql
-- 1. Total revenue this month
SELECT SUM(total_revenue) as monthly_revenue
FROM v_revenue_report 
WHERE month = DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(), '%Y-%m');

-- 2. Most active users
SELECT username, total_rentals_made
FROM v_user_statistics 
ORDER BY total_rentals_made DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- 3. Tool utilization rate
SELECT 
    t.name,
    COUNT(rt.id) as total_rentals,
    DATEDIFF(MAX(rt.end_date), MIN(rt.start_date)) as days_available,
    (COUNT(rt.id) / DATEDIFF(MAX(rt.end_date), MIN(rt.start_date))) * 100 as utilization_rate
FROM api_tool t
LEFT JOIN api_rentaltransaction rt ON t.id = rt.tool_id
GROUP BY t.id, t.name;

-- 4. Average rental duration
SELECT 
    AVG(DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date)) as avg_rental_days
FROM api_rentaltransaction 
WHERE status = 'completed';

-- 5. Revenue by tool category
SELECT 
    tc.name as category,
    SUM(rt.total_price) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(rt.id) as total_rentals
FROM api_rentaltransaction rt
JOIN api_tool t ON rt.tool_id = t.id
JOIN api_tool_category tc ON t.category_id = tc.id
WHERE rt.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY tc.id, tc.name;
```

### User Management Queries

```sql
-- 1. Users who haven't logged in recently
SELECT username, email, last_login
FROM api_user 
WHERE last_login < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);

-- 2. Users with pending payments
SELECT 
    u.username,
    rt.id as rental_id,
    rt.total_price,
    rt.payment_status
FROM api_rentaltransaction rt
JOIN api_user u ON rt.borrower_id = u.id
WHERE rt.payment_status = 'pending';

-- 3. Users with low ratings
SELECT username, rating
FROM api_user 
WHERE rating < 3.0
ORDER BY rating ASC;
```

### Tool Management Queries

```sql
-- 1. Tools that haven't been rented
SELECT t.name, t.created_at
FROM api_tool t
LEFT JOIN api_rentaltransaction rt ON t.id = rt.tool_id
WHERE rt.id IS NULL;

-- 2. Tools with maintenance due
SELECT 
    t.name,
    ml.maintenance_date,
    ml.next_maintenance_date
FROM api_tool t
JOIN api_maintenance_log ml ON t.id = ml.tool_id
WHERE ml.next_maintenance_date <= CURDATE();

-- 3. Tools with highest revenue
SELECT 
    t.name,
    SUM(rt.total_price) as total_revenue
FROM api_tool t
JOIN api_rentaltransaction rt ON t.id = rt.tool_id
WHERE rt.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY t.id, t.name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

## üîç Performance Tips

### Using Indexes
The database includes indexes for better performance:

```sql
-- Check if indexes are being used
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM api_rentaltransaction WHERE status = 'active';

-- Monitor slow queries
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'slow_query_log';
```

### Query Optimization

```sql
-- Use LIMIT for large result sets
SELECT * FROM v_user_statistics LIMIT 100;

-- Use specific columns instead of *
SELECT username, email, rating FROM api_user WHERE rating > 4.0;

-- Use date ranges for time-based queries
SELECT * FROM api_rentaltransaction 
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

```sql
-- 1. Update user statistics
UPDATE api_user u
SET total_rentals = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM api_rentaltransaction rt 
    WHERE rt.borrower_id = u.id
);

-- 2. Clean up old sessions
DELETE FROM django_session 
WHERE expire_date < NOW();

-- 3. Archive old rentals
INSERT INTO api_rental_archive
SELECT * FROM api_rentaltransaction 
WHERE status = 'completed' 
AND updated_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR);

-- 4. Update tool availability
UPDATE api_tool t
SET available = NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM api_rentaltransaction rt
    WHERE rt.tool_id = t.id 
    AND rt.status = 'active'
);
```

## üìä Reporting Examples

FROM api_rentaltransaction rt
WHERE rt.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(rt.created_at)
ORDER BY date;
```

    COUNT(DISTINCT rt.tool_id) as unique_tools
FROM api_rentaltransaction rt
WHERE rt.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 12 MONTH)
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(rt.created_at, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Distance Calculation
```sql
-- Find tools within 10km of a location
SELECT 
    t.name,
    t.daily_rate,
    fn_calculate_distance(30.2672, -97.7431, t.latitude, t.longitude) as distance_km
FROM api_tool t
WHERE t.available = TRUE
AND fn_calculate_distance(30.2672, -97.7431, t.latitude, t.longitude) <= 10
ORDER BY distance_km;
```

### User Recommendations

SELECT 
    t.name,
    t.daily_rate,
    COUNT(rt.id) as rental_count
FROM api_tool t
JOIN api_rentaltransaction rt ON t.id = rt.tool_id
WHERE rt.borrower_id = 1  -- User ID
AND t.available = TRUE
GROUP BY t.id, t.name, t.daily_rate
ORDER BY rental_count DESC;
